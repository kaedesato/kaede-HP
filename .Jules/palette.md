## 2026-02-18 - Mobile Navigation Accessibility Gap
**Learning:** The mobile menu toggle button (`.lg:hidden`) was completely inaccessible to screen readers, lacking `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`. This is a critical barrier for navigation on mobile devices.
**Action:** Always audit mobile-specific controls (like hamburger menus) for accessibility attributes, especially when they toggle visibility of other elements. Ensure state changes (`aria-expanded`) are communicated.
